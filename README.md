# Hyper Constants
Hyper Constants is a Java library providing a set of constants with 8192 digits of precision. This library is designed to be used in scientific computing, cryptography, and other applications where high precision is required. The library includes constants such as pi, e, and the golden ratio.

## Constants
- `PI`: `HyperConstants.PI`
- `E`: `HyperConstants.E`
- `PHI`: `HyperConstants.PHI` **OR** `HyperConstants.GOLDEN_RATIO`
- `TAU`: `HyperConstants.TAU`
- `C`: `HyperConstants.C` (This is not 8192 digits, but a constant for the speed of light in m/s)
